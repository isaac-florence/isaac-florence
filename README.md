# 👋 Hi, I’m @isaac-florence

I'm an Infectious Disease Epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency. 

## Although I am epidemiologist by training, my work currently also includes:
- (Managing small, medium, and big teams)
- Data Science in R (stats, visualisation, dashboards, and basic modelling)
- Data engineering in SQL and Python (data warehouse and data lake management, pipellines, and metrics creation)
- Software engineering in Python (clinical data systems, systems and data integration, and analytical/developer/engineering tools)
- DevOps with Kubernetes (OpenShift) and Git (CI/CD with GitLab, GitHub etc, ArgoCD, and Kustomize to deploy in OpenShift Kubernetes)
- Data Architecture (data modelling, data platform design and setup, application design and integration)


## 👀 I’m interested in _everything_, but principally:
- Epidemiology analysis
- Data engineering (cleaning, QAing, linking, aggregating, and making epidemiology data easier to use)
- Clinical data systems and data capture; helping clinical public health services to succeed with technology, not be inhibited by it 
- Data management and discovery
- Security and data governance
- (True) Cloud-Native computing
- Databases (DBMS fan - fan of Postgres MS SQL)
- Distributed and parallel computing (Spark, Trino, Citus, etc)
- Secure and/or Trusted Analytics/Research Environments
- Federated clinical data systems and secure data exchange
- Unix (RHEL Linux & Mac OS) 


## 📚 I'm currently learning:
- How the internet works (DNS and IP)
- More Python
- Streaming data (with Kafka) and real-time processing
- Next generation query languages ([EdgeQL](https://www.edgedb.com/) and [PRQL](https://prql-lang.org/))
- C++ 


## 🔎 I'd like to learn more about:
- Scala (with some Java for fun)
- C
- Bioinformatics
- Machine learning


## 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- Using data and developing technology in government and the civil service
- Health (particularly infectious disease) data
- Making sensitive data use secure, fast, and scalable

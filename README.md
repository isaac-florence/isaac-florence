# 👋 Hi, I’m @isaac-florence

I'm a [Field Epidemiologist](https://www.cdc.gov/eis/field-epi-manual/chapters/Defining-Field-Epi.html) at the [UK Health Security Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-health-security-agency). 

## Although I am an epidemiologist by training, my work currently also includes:
- Leading small, medium, and big teams of epidemiologists, data scientists, and software developers
- Data science in R (stats, visualisation, dashboards, and basic modelling)
- Data engineering in SQL and Python (data warehouse and data lake management, pipelines, linkage, QA, and metrics creation)
- Software engineering in Python (clinical data capture systems, systems and data integration, and analytical/developer/engineering tools)
- DevOps with Kubernetes (OpenShift) and Git (CI/CD with GitLab, GitHub etc, ArgoCD, and Kustomize to deploy in OpenShift Kubernetes)
- Technical architecture (data modelling, data platform design, system design and integration)

## 👀 I’m interested in _everything_, but principally:

- Epidemiology analysis and its communication
- Helping public health and clinical health protection services to succeed with technology, not in spite of is
- Federated clinical data frameworks
- Cloud-native nomputing

## 📚 I'm currently learning:
- Network architecture
- More Python, C++, and JavaScript
- Streaming data and real-time processing
- Cyber security architecture
- Rust

## 🔎 I'd like to learn more about:
- Scala
- C
- Bioinformatics
- Machine learning

## 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- Using data and developing technology in government and the civil service
- Health (particularly infectious disease) data and clinical systems
- Making sensitive data use secure, fast, and scalable

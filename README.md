# 👋 Hi, I’m @isaac-florence

I'm an Infectious Disease Epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency. 

## Although I am epidemiologist by training, my work currently also includes:
- (Managing small, medium, and big teams)
- Data Science in R (stats, visualisation, dashboards, and basic modelling)
- Data engineering in SQL and Python (data warehouse and data lake management, pipelines, linkage, QA, and metrics creation)
- Software engineering in Python (clinical data capture systems, systems and data integration, and analytical/developer/engineering tools)
- DevOps with Kubernetes (OpenShift) and Git (CI/CD with GitLab, GitHub etc, ArgoCD, and Kustomize to deploy in OpenShift Kubernetes)
- Data Architecture (data modelling, data platform design and setup, application design and integration)


## 👀 I’m interested in _everything_, but principally:

### Practices
- Epidemiology analysis
- Helping public health and clinical health protection services to succeed with technology, not in spite of it 
- Data engineering (cleaning, QAing, linking, aggregating - enabling epidemiology data analysis)
- Data management and discovery
- Security and data governance
- Federated clinical data frameworks (multi-agency and international collaboration and coordination)
- Cloud-native nomputing

### Tools
- Clinical data systems and data capture
- Open source software
- Containerisation and Kubernetes
- Databases (fan of Postgres, MS SQL, and MariaDB)
- Distributed and parallel computing (Spark, Trino, Citus, etc)
- Secure and/or Trusted Analytics/Research Environments


## 📚 I'm currently learning:
- How the internet works (DNS and IP)
- More Python, C++, and JavaScript
- Streaming data (with Kafka, etc) and real-time processing
- Next-generation query languages ([EdgeQL](https://www.edgedb.com/) and [PRQL](https://prql-lang.org/))


## 🔎 I'd like to learn more about:
- Scala (with some Java for fun)
- C
- Bioinformatics
- Machine learning


## 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- Using data and developing technology in government and the civil service
- Health (particularly infectious disease) data
- Making sensitive data use secure, fast, and scalable
